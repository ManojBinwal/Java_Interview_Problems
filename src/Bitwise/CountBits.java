/*
Writing a program to count the number of bits that are set to 1 in an integer is a good way to get up
to speed with primitive types. The following program tests bits oneï¿¾at-a-time starting with the
least-significant bit. It illustrates shifting and masking; it also shows how to avoid hard-coding
the size of the integer word.
